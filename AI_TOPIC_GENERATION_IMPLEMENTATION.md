# AI Topic Generation Implementation

## Overview
Simplified the topic tracking system by removing the separate Topic collection and TopicPerformance tracking. Topics are now auto-generated using AI when quizzes are created, making the system more streamlined and reducing complexity.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Backend - Quiz Service** (`Backend/src/services/quizService.js`)
- ✅ Added `generateTopicFromContent()` function that uses AI to generate concise topic names (2-5 words) from PDF content
- ✅ Modified `generateQuiz()` to automatically generate a topic if none is provided by the user
- ✅ Removed imports for `topicService` and `Topic` schema
- ✅ Removed individual question topic assignment logic

**How it works:**
- When a quiz is generated, if no topic is provided, AI analyzes the first 1500 characters of content
- Generates a concise, descriptive topic name (e.g., "Machine Learning Basics", "React Hooks")
- The generated topic is stored in the Quiz schema's `topic` field

### 2. **Backend - Quiz Routes** (`Backend/src/routes/quiz.js`)
- ✅ Simplified quiz submission by removing TopicPerformance tracking
- ✅ Removed complex logic for tracking individual question topics
- ✅ Removed `TopicPerformance` import
- ✅ Quiz topic is now simply stored with the QuizAttempt

### 3. **Backend - Analytics Routes** (`Backend/src/routes/analytics.js`)
- ✅ Completely rewrote topic analytics to use QuizAttempt data directly
- ✅ Removed dependency on TopicPerformance collection
- ✅ Removed dependency on Topic schema
- ✅ Calculate weak/strong topics from quiz attempts grouped by topic name
- ✅ Added `level` field (weak/moderate/strong) to topic mastery data for heatmap visualization

**New Logic:**
- Weak topics: < 60% average score across quiz attempts
- Moderate topics: 60-79% average score
- Strong topics: ≥ 80% average score

### 4. **Backend - PDF Routes** (`Backend/src/routes/pdfRoutes.js`)
- ✅ Removed `generateTopicsAsync()` function
- ✅ Removed calls to topic generation on PDF upload
- ✅ Added comments explaining the removal

### 5. **Backend - App Configuration** (`Backend/src/app.js`)
- ✅ Removed `topicsRouter` import
- ✅ Removed `/api/topics` route registration
- ✅ Added explanatory comment

### 6. **Frontend - Quiz Generator** (`Frontend/src/components/Quiz/QuizGenerator.jsx`)
- ✅ Updated topic input label to indicate AI auto-generation
- ✅ Added logic to populate the topic input field with AI-generated topic after quiz generation
- ✅ Updated placeholder text to guide users
- ✅ Topic field remains optional but will be auto-filled if left empty

**User Experience:**
1. User leaves topic field empty (or fills it in manually)
2. Clicks "Generate Quiz"
3. If empty, AI generates a topic from the content
4. Generated topic appears in the input field
5. User can see and edit the topic before starting the quiz

## What Was Removed
- ❌ `Backend/src/services/topicService.js` - No longer needed (file can be deleted)
- ❌ `Backend/src/routes/topics.js` - No longer used (file can be deleted)
- ❌ `Backend/src/schemas/Topic.js` - No longer used (can be deleted)
- ❌ `Backend/src/schemas/TopicPerformance.js` - No longer used (can be deleted)
- ❌ Separate topic generation on PDF upload
- ❌ Complex per-question topic tracking
- ❌ `/api/topics` endpoints

## What Stays
- ✅ Quiz schema's `topic` field (now populated by AI)
- ✅ QuizAttempt schema's `topic` field (stores the quiz topic)
- ✅ Dashboard analytics showing weak/strong topics
- ✅ Topic mastery heatmap visualization
- ✅ All quiz functionality

## Benefits
1. **Simplicity**: No separate topic management system
2. **Automatic**: Topics generated automatically without user effort
3. **Flexible**: Users can still manually specify topics if desired
4. **Consistent**: Every quiz has a meaningful topic name
5. **Less Storage**: No separate Topic and TopicPerformance collections
6. **Better UX**: Users see AI-generated topics and can modify them

## Dashboard Analytics
The dashboard continues to show:
- Topic Mastery heatmap (color-coded by performance)
- Weak topics (< 60% accuracy)
- Strong topics (≥ 80% accuracy)
- Performance trends by topic

All calculated directly from QuizAttempt data using the quiz's topic field.

## Migration Notes
- Existing quizzes with topics will continue to work
- Existing QuizAttempts with topics will be used for analytics
- Old Topic and TopicPerformance collections can be safely deleted
- No data migration needed - the system works with existing data

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Generate a quiz without specifying a topic → AI generates one
- [ ] Generate a quiz with a manual topic → Uses the provided topic
- [ ] Check that topic appears in input field after generation
- [ ] Submit quiz and verify topic is stored in QuizAttempt
- [ ] View dashboard analytics → weak/strong topics display correctly
- [ ] Topic mastery heatmap displays with correct colors
- [ ] Performance trend shows topic names

## Files Modified
1. `Backend/src/services/quizService.js`
2. `Backend/src/routes/quiz.js`
3. `Backend/src/routes/analytics.js`
4. `Backend/src/routes/pdfRoutes.js`
5. `Backend/src/app.js`
