## Visual Improvements

## Features

1. **Title Priority**: PDFs now display their custom titles prominently
2. **Fallback Support**: If no title is set, falls back to filename (without .pdf extension)
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Active sessions are clearly distinguished with accent gradients
4. **Hover Effects**: Smooth animations provide tactile feedback
5. **Multi-line Titles**: Long titles wrap to 2 lines with ellipsis
6. **Icon Enhancement**: Larger, more visible file icons with dynamic effects

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with PDFs that have custom titles
2. Test with PDFs that only have filenames
3. Verify hover animations are smooth
4. Check active state styling
5. Test responsive behavior on mobile devices
6. Verify long titles wrap correctly

## Benefits

- **Better UX**: Users can identify PDFs by their meaningful titles
- **Modern Design**: Gradient effects and animations provide a premium feel
