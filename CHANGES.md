# Changes Made: PDF Key Points Feature

## Summary
Renamed `ai.service.js` to `chapters.service.js` and implemented automatic key points generation from PDF content. Key points are now generated using AI when a PDF is uploaded and displayed on the library page alongside chapters and summary.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Service Layer (`Backend/src/services/`)
- **Renamed**: `ai.service.js` → `chapters.service.js`
- **Added**: `generateKeyPoints(text)` function that uses LLM to extract 5-8 key points from PDF content
- The function returns a JSON array of concise key points/highlights

### 2. Database Schema (`Backend/src/schemas/Pdf.js`)
- **Added**: `keyPoints` field (array of strings) to store generated key points
- Default value: empty array `[]`

### 3. Routes (`Backend/src/routes/pdfRoutes.js`)
- **Updated import**: Changed from `ai.service.js` to `chapters.service.js`
- **Added import**: `generateKeyPoints` function
- **Modified upload endpoints**:
  - `/upload` endpoint now generates key points alongside chapters and summary
  - `/from-url` endpoint now generates key points alongside chapters and summary
- **Updated listHandler**: Includes `keyPoints` field in the API response when listing PDFs

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Library Page (`Frontend/src/pages/LibraryPage.jsx`)
- **Updated data mapping**: Added `keyPoints` field when loading PDF list
- **Added UI section**: Displays key points below the chapters section
- Key points are shown with bullet points in a styled container
- Only displays when `keyPoints` array has items

### 2. Styling (`Frontend/src/pages/LibraryPage.module.css`)
- **Added `.keyPoints`**: Container styling with background and border
- **Added `.keyPoint`**: Individual key point item styling
- **Added `.keyPointBullet`**: Styled bullet point in accent color

## How It Works

1. **When a PDF is uploaded**:
   - PDF content is extracted using `pdf-parse`
   - AI generates chapters, summary, AND key points from the content
   - All three are stored in the database for that specific user's PDF

2. **When viewing the library**:
   - Key points are fetched along with other PDF metadata
   - Displayed in a styled section below chapters
   - Each key point appears as a bullet point with the accent color

3. **User-specific storage**:
   - Key points are stored per user and per PDF in MongoDB
   - Each user gets their own AI-generated key points for their uploaded PDFs

## Example Key Points Format
```json
[
  "Newton's laws of motion describe the relationship between forces and motion",
  "Kinetic energy is proportional to mass and velocity squared",
  "Conservation of momentum applies in closed systems",
  "Work is defined as force applied over a distance",
  "Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed"
]
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Automatic extraction of important concepts from PDF content
- ✅ Helps students quickly understand key topics
- ✅ Stored in database for fast retrieval
- ✅ User-specific and PDF-specific
- ✅ Consistent with existing summary feature
