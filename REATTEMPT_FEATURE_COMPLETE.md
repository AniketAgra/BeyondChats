- QuizAttempt schema stores quiz reference for reattempts

**Database Structure:**
```javascript
QuizAttempt {
  user: ObjectId,
  quiz: ObjectId,        // Reference to original quiz
  pdf: ObjectId,
  topic: String,
  difficulty: String,
  questions: Array,      // Stored for this attempt
  responses: Array,
  results: Array,
  score: Number,
  correct: Number,
  total: Number
}

Quiz {

```

### âœ… 4. Frontend Quiz Flow (Already Exists)

6. Shows "Quiz Ready for Reattempt" screen
7. User clicks "Start Quiz" â†’ QuizPlayer loads with same questions
