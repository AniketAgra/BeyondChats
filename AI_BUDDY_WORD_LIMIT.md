  return trimmed + '... 💬 [Visit AI Mentor for complete answer]'
}
```

#### 3. **Modified Prompt**
```javascript
function buildAssistantPrompt(question, pdfContext, conversationHistory, isLimited = true) {
  // Instructs AI to keep responses SHORT
  parts.push('IMPORTANT: Keep responses SHORT and CONCISE (maximum 80-100 words, 2-3 sentences).')

  // ... more instructions
}
```

let wordCount = 0
const response = await client.generateStream({ 
  prompt, 
  onChunk: (chunk) => {
    const words = chunk.split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 0)
    wordCount += words.length
    
    if (wordCount <= 100) {
      onChunk(chunk)
    } else if (!isTrimmed) {
