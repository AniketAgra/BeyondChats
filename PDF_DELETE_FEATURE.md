## Technical Details

### Data Deletion Order
1. Related data (KeyFeatures, Notes, Chat, Quizzes, etc.)
2. Storage file (from Supabase)
3. PDF document record (from MongoDB)

### Error Handling
- Storage deletion errors don't prevent database cleanup
- Failed deletions show user-friendly error messages
- Backend logs detailed error information for debugging

### Security
- Only authenticated users can delete PDFs
- Users can only delete their own PDFs
- Ownership verification prevents unauthorized deletions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Successful Deletion**
   - Upload a PDF
   - Add notes, generate quiz, chat with AI
   - Delete the PDF
   - Verify all data is removed

2. **Cancellation**
   - Click delete button
   - Click "Cancel" in confirmation dialog
   - Verify PDF remains intact

3. **Permission Check**
   - Attempt to delete another user's PDF (via API)
   - Verify 404 error is returned

4. **Error Handling**
   - Simulate storage error
   - Verify PDF still gets deleted from database

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Soft delete with restore capability
- Bulk delete for multiple PDFs
- Export data before deletion
- Trash/recycle bin feature
