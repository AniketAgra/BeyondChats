## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows loading forever
- Check backend is running on port 4000
- Check MongoDB connection
- Check browser console for API errors

### Empty states despite having data
- Verify QuizAttempt documents have required fields

- Inspect network tab for 500 errors

### Charts not displaying
- Ensure `recharts` is installed: `npm install recharts`
- Check console for React errors
- Verify data format matches expected structure
